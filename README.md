Step 2:
When running the server.c file it outputs:
"Server is alive and waiting for socket connection from client"
then does nothing

when running the client.c file it outputs:
"Client is alive and establishing socket connection
 Error establishing communication: connection refused.
 
 Step 5:
 When running the server.c file it outputs:
"Server is alive and waiting for socket connection from client
Server has written 1 to socket.


Server has written 2 to socket.


Server has written 3 to socket.


Server has written 4 to socket.


Server has written 5 to socket.


Server has written 6 to socket.


Server has written 7 to socket.


Server has written 8 to socket.


Server has written 9 to socket.


Server has written 10 to socket."

when running the client.c file it outputs:
"Client is alive and establishing socket connection


Client has recieved 1 from socket.


Client has recieved 2 from socket.


Client has recieved 3 from socket.


Client has recieved 4 from socket.


Client has recieved 5 from socket.


Client has recieved 6 from socket.


Client has recieved 7 from socket.


Client has recieved 8 from socket.


Client has recieved 9 from socket.


Client has recieved 10 from socket."

Step 6:
when running the client.c file without running the server.c file first, it outputs:
